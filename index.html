        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>As a high school student, I was involved with sports including baseball and snowboardings. I was always math oriented when it came to my learning. I felt like I could see the problem being solved and change the numbers around in my head just by looking at it. In college I pursued physics to try to apply these satisfying concepts to how life works. It was not until I found web development that I felt like I was getting that same level of satisfaction from the problems I was solving, and now I feel like I have a whole new level of creativity to explore.<br>
        <br>
        After finding the world of coding I self taught myself for a year and a half, becoming very familiar with JavaScript, HTML, CSS. I used this time to make sure I truly had an interest in this industry before investing in myself with a bootcamp, and now I sit here two weeks in to the Thinkful program and I am loving it and looking forward to this career.</p>
